# W.I.S.E.
This is a program in which I incorporated all the sensors that I used in my previous programs, the AQI sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, Hall Effect sensor, Temperature and Humidity sensor and the OLED display in order to create a miniature weather system. In this project, I individually callibrated each sensor and 3-D printed my own anemometer (wind speed measurer) which, using the hall effect sensor, calculated the wind speeds. I callibrated this anemometer in Plaksha University's minitature indoor wind tunnel. Combining all of these sensors into one large circuit, I finally ended up with a finished prototype that gave accurate readings of the weather conditions around it.
W.I.S.E -> Weather Information System for the Elderly. This project is aimed at assisting elderly people. They can install the device outside their window so that they can know about the weather in their immediate surroundings and, with the help of a servo motor, can automatically open or close their windows.
